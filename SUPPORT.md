There are three options for asking questions and getting support:

1. As a new post in the official [Julia discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org/) and ask a question under the category Specific Domains > Modelling & Simulations. If your issue is related with nonlinear dynamics or timeseries analysis, use `dynamical-systems` as a tag. If it is related with agent based modelling, use `agents` as a tag.
2. As a message in our channel `#dynamics-bridged` in the [Julia Slack](https://julialang.org/slack/) workplace.
3. By opening an issue directly on GitHub. This is the most useful approach when you encounter unexpected behaviour.
